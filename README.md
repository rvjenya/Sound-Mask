# Sound-Mask
Sound assistant/face mask detection and sound are alerting.  Think… how often the establishment's staff repeats the phrase "Please wear a protective mask!"  Always notifying and reminding clients to wear a face protection mask is growing a business routine.  The solution is a sound AI of assistant that visually recognizes and talks about compliance with quarantine rules.  Staff should NOT do work that a machine can ALREADY do.  And this is possible with our sound assistant!  Please SET it UP to making business and turn it ON, then quickly the machine takes over all the staff's routine work.
